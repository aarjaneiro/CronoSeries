# CronoSeries
A Cronos fork focusing only on Time Series Analysis
---------------------------------------------------
For the original Cronos project, visit https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=cronos.

Based on the implementation of  https://github.com/dsass/ARIMA

This library features models commonly used in time series analysis, including:
1. ARMA
2. ARMAX
3. GARCH (of various types)
4. Vector Autoregressive Models

... and more!

Documentation
-------------

Visit https://aarjaneiro.github.io/CronoSeries/

Local documentation can be generated by using DoxyGen.
Simply run
```
doxygen DoxyGen
```
and the directory `/docs/` will appear. Opening index.html will bring you to the main page (which is mostly empty), though namespaces 
and classes, etc, are all accessible for the most part.


TODO:
-----
1. Implement tests.
2. Add examples.
3. Fix types (e.g., `object` â†’ specific type implementations)
